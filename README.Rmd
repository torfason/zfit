## Overview

```{r child="man/include/overview.Rmd"}
```



## Installation

Install the release version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zfit) with:

``` r
install.packages("zfit")
```

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/torfason/zfit) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("torfason/zfit")
```

## Examples

The examples below assume that the following packages are loaded:

``` r
library(zfit)
library(dplyr)
```

The most basic use of the functions in this package is to pass a `data.frame`/`tibble` to `zlm()`:

``` r
cars %>% zlm( speed ~ dist )
```

Often, it is useful to process the `data.frame`/`tibble` before passing it to `zlm()`:

``` r
iris %>%
  filter( Species=="setosa" ) %>%
  zlm( Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Petal.Width )
```

The `zprint()` function provides a simple way to "tee" the piped object for printing a derived object, but then passing the *original* object onward through the pipe. The following code pipes an estimation model object into `zprint(summary)`. This means that the `summary()` function is called on the model being passed through the pipe, and the resulting summary is printed. However, `zprint(summary)` then returns the original model object, which is assigned to `m`  (instead of assigning the summary object):

``` r
m <- iris %>%
  filter(Species=="setosa") %>%
  zlm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Petal.Width) %>%
  zprint(summary)
```

The `zprint()` function is quite useful within an estimation pipeline to print a summary of an object without returning the summary (using `zprint(summary)` as above), but it can also be used independently from estimation models, such as to print a summarized version of a tibble within a pipeline before further processing, without breaking the pipeline:

``` r
sw_subset <- starwars %>%
  zprint(count, homeworld, sort=TRUE) %>% # prints counts by homeworld
  filter(homeworld=="Tatooine")
sw_subset  # sw_subset is ungrouped, but filtered by homeworld
```
