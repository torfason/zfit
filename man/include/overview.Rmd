The goal of `zfit` is to make it easier to use a piped workflow with functions that don't have the "correct" order of parameters (the first parameter of the function does not match the object passing through the pipe). This issue is especially prevalent with model fitting functions, such as when passing and processing a `data.frame` (or `tibble`) before passing them to `lm()` or similar functions. The pipe passes the data object (`data.frame`/`tibble`) into the first parameter of the function, but the conventional estimation functions expect a formula to be the first parameter.

When using `magrittr` style pipes (`%>%`), this can be addressed by using special syntax, specifying `data=.` to pass the piped data into a parameter other than the first one. With R native pipes (`|>`), however, this is not possible and workaround are needed (such as constructing an anonymous function for each estimation or relying on complex rules about how piped arguments are interpreted in the presence of named parameters).

To address this, this package includes functions such as [zlm()] and [zglm()]. These are very similar to the core estimation functions such as `lm()` and `glm()`, but expect the first argument to be a (`data.frame`/`tibble`) rather than a formula (the formula becomes the second argument).

More importantly, the package includes two functions that make it trivial to construct a pipe-friendly version of any function. The [zfitter()] function takes any estimation function with the standard format of a `formula` and `data` parameter, and returns a version suitable for us in pipes (with the `data` parameter coming first). The [zfitter()] function also does some special handling to make make the call information more useful. 

The [zfunction()] works for any function but omits the special handling for call parameters. Just pass the name of a function, and the name of the parameter that should receive the piped argument, and it returns a version of the function with that parameter coming first.  

The package also includes the [zprint()] function, which is intended to simplify the printing of derived results, such as `summary()`, within the pipe, without affecting the modeling result itself. It also includes convenience functions for calling estimation functions using particular parameters, including [zlogit()] and [zprobit()], and [zpoisson()], to perform logistic or poisson regression within a pipe.

*Note that some of the examples provided in the help and documentation use magrittr-style (`%>%`) pipe syntax, while others use the native pipe syntax (`|>`). The package has been tested with both types of pipe functionality and the results are identical, apart from the fact that `%>%` renames the piped argument to `.`, whereas the name of the piped argument is the complete nested function syntax of the pipe.*
